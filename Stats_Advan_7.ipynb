    "Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "  - Known Population Variances: We know the population variances are 10 and 15.\n",
    "  - Sample Size: We have a sample size of 12 from each population.\n",
    "  - Significance Level: The significance level is set at 0.05 (5%).    \n",

    "What the F-test would likely show:\n",
    "  - The F-test statistic would likely be greater than 1 (since 15 is larger than 10).\n",
    "  - By looking up the critical F-value for a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, degrees of freedom (df1) = 11 (sample size - 1 for population 1), and degrees of freedom (df2) = 11 (sample size - 1 for population 2), we would compare the F-statistic to the critical value.\n",

Here, It means we fail to reject the null hypothesis : variance are not significantly different."
