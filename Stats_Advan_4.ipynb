    "   - Since the sample size (n=50) is relatively large, we can assume a normal distribution and use the standard normal z-table.\n",
    "   - For a 90% confidence level, the significance level is split in half (α/2) for a two-tailed test, which is 0.10 / 2 = 0.05.\n",
    "   - Using a z-table, the critical value (z) corresponding to 0.05 (one-tailed probability) is approximately 1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Error (SE):\n",
    "   - The standard error considers the population standard deviation (σ) and sample size (n) and reflects the sampling variability.\n",
    "   - SE = σ / sqrt(n) = 8 / sqrt(50) ≈ 1.13\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Confidence Interval (CI):\n",
    "   - The confidence interval captures the range where the true population mean is likely to reside with a certain level of confidence (90% in this case).\n",
    "   - CI = x̄ ± (z * SE)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculation:\n",
    "   - CI = 65 ± (1.645 * 1.13) ≈ (62.73, 67.27)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Interpretation:\n",
    "   - We can be 90% confident that the true population mean (μ) falls between 62.73 and 67.27. Even though the sample mean (65) deviates slightly from the population mean (60), the confidence interval encompasses both values due to sampling variability.\n"

    "   - Null Hypothesis (H0): Caffeine has no significant effect on reaction time. The population mean reaction time with and without caffeine is equal (μ = μ₀, some pre-defined value).\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time. The population mean reaction time is different with and without caffeine (μ ≠ μ₀).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choosing the Test:\n",
    "   - We have one sample, and we're comparing it to a hypothetical value (no caffeine effect).\n",
    "   - Since the sample size (n = 30) is less than 30 and the population standard deviation is unknown, we'll use a one-tailed t-test.\n",

    "   - Sample Mean (x̄) = 0.25 seconds\n",
    "   - Sample Standard Deviation (SD) = 0.05 seconds\n",

    "   - Calculate the t-statistic:\n",
    "     - We are using t-table to find the t-statistic based on the sample mean, standard deviation, and sample size.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Degrees of Freedom (df):\n",
    "     - df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Critical Value:\n",
    "     - Look up the one-tailed critical t-value for a significance level of 0.10 (one-tailed test) and degrees of freedom (df) of 29. \n",
    "     - Using a t-table, find the critical value (t_critical).\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Decision Rule:\n",
    "     - Reject H0 (caffeine has an effect) if the calculated t-statistic is less than the critical t-value (t_critical) since we're interested in a decrease in reaction time (one-tailed test).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interpretation:\n",
    "   - Based on the calculated t-statistic, critical value, and decision rule, you can determine if there's enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time."
