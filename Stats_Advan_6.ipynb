    "ANOVA makes some key assumptions about your data to ensure accurate results. Here are the main ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Normality: The data within each group should be normally distributed (bell-shaped curve). Violation: If your data is heavily skewed or has outliers, the results may not be reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Homogeneity of variance: The variances (spread) of the data should be equal across all groups. Violation: Unequal variances can inflate the effect of groups with higher variance, leading to misleading conclusions.\n",

    "### Problem_12:  A researcher wants to know if there are any significant differences in the average daily sales of three retail stores: Store A, Store B, and Store C. They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other."
